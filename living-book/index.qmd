# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a living book of notes for the [graph neural network reading group](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/gnn-reading-group) at The Alan Turing Institute.

To contribute, please make a PR to the repository linked above after we've had a session on your chosen topic. Write your notes in any of the supported formats for Quarto (`.qmd`, `.md`, or `.ipynb`), and Quarto will do all of the legwork to publish it to this webpage!
